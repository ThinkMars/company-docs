# Management Backend

⚠️ Note: Due to sensitive information in the management backend, the backend code access is temporarily closed. A separate code repository will be forked for open source later.

The management backend is used for managing product-related configurations, user permissions, code deployment operations, metrics monitoring visualization, etc.
